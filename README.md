# Calculator-Java

## Overview
The **Calculator-Java** program is a Java-based application that provides a variety of mathematical operations, including basic arithmetic and statistical calculations. It features a user-friendly console interface, making it easy for users to perform calculations directly from the command line.

## Features

### Basic Arithmetic Operations
- **Addition**: Adds two numbers.
- **Subtraction**: Subtracts the second number from the first.
- **Multiplication**: Multiplies two numbers.
- **Division**: Divides the first number by the second, with error handling for division by zero.

### Array-Based Statistical Operations
- **Sum of an Array**: Computes the total sum of elements in an array.
- **Mean (Average)**: Calculates the mean of the elements in an array.
- **Mode**: Determines the most frequently occurring number in an array.
- **Median**: Finds the middle value when the elements are sorted.
- **Variance**: Measures the dispersion of numbers in an array.
- **Standard Deviation**: Calculates how much the numbers deviate from the mean.

## Getting Started
To use the Calculator program, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the **Java Development Kit (JDK)** installed on your system.

### Installation & Execution
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/rams-v/OST-Calculator.git
   cd OST-Calculator
   ```
2. **Compile the Java Files:**
   ```sh
   javac Calculator.java
   ```
3. **Run the Program:**
   ```sh
   java Calculator
   ```

### Usage
- Follow the on-screen prompts to input numbers and select operations.
- For statistical operations, provide an array of numbers as input.
- The program will display the calculated result accordingly.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement additional mathematical functions such as exponentiation and logarithms.
- Enhance user interaction with a graphical user interface (GUI).
- Include history tracking for past calculations.
